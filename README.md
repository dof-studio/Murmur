# Murmur
Murmur is an AI Assistant who can generate subtitles for any kind of audio streams/files. Everything built in Python and easy to run.

Its backend transcription model may be customizable, but we recommend `whisper` series from OpenAI.

# Srouce code? Release?
We super-strongly recommend users to use the `release` stable versions, for the following two reasons:
* 1. They have included inclusive models fine-tuned on multi-language datasets
* 2. They have installed ffmpeg and other required env related tools
* 3. When Python and Modules are ready, they are simply ready to use

# How to use it?
* Step 1) Install Python 3.7 and pip
(find here https://www.python.org/downloads/)

* Step 2) Install essential dependence
(the `requirements.txt` can be found at the `src` folder)

* Step 3) Install ffmpeg, models | or | Download our stable release version
(you may need: ffmpeg, whisper models to be installed, see subfolder `.md` files)

* Step 4) Run pipeline script | or | Batch files
